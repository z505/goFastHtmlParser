# goFastHtmlParser
converted fpc fasthtmlparser to go
NOTE: this is not correctly formatted Go code yet.
Just initial conversion to verify it works.

Will definitely clean up and polish later!

Fast Html Parser is a classic and simple but powerful HTML parser originally written by James Azarja for freepascal.

Converted to Go without much effort, but really needs much polishing and cleaning up still to have correct golang formatting and aesthetics.
